# Password-Generator

## Description

This application provides an example of Javascript usage to create a random password generate that follows certain criteria. This criteria is provided by the user when asking for a new password.

This password generator follows these criteria:
* Length of password (this has to be between 10 and 64 characters).
* If lowercase characters should be included.
* If uppercase characters should be included.
* If numerical characters should be included.
* If special characters should be included.

This application works by creating an array of possible characters after following the criteria the user submits. It then creates an array of random numbers up to the total characters chosen earlier, of a length that the user decides. Using these random numbers, the characters are selected and then made into a string to output as the users randomly generated password.

## Usage
